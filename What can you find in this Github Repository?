                        1. Database Restaurant made by me: 

I worked with a restaurant for learning purposes, and created them a Tableau project with 5 different files:
  -Sales (Ventas)
  -Revenue (Caja)
  -Menu (Carta)
  -Wines (Vinos)
  -Shops(Tiendas)

The main file is the Sales (Ventas), since it contains an ID connecting it to the rest of files.

                        2. Data Analysis Project:

Using Youtube Videos, I worked with several databases, and learned to clean them and getting information out of them. (I am still working on this project).

                        3. EAE Portfolio Project:

For my introduction to programming languages we created a website. On that file you can find all the resources used.

This is the website link: https://portfolio-vic.streamlit.app/Temperatures_Dashboard

                        4. Python Basics Learning:

That is another Youtube course I took, but that gets more deep into Python, and I used it to learn all the basics.
